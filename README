DISCLAMER - OPENCORE 0.6.0

I've had really bad luck with Hackintosh (Running macOS on non-Apple Hardware), and I mean REALLY BAD.

I myself have an MSI B365 Pro VDH (Mind you, a chipset that people are told to AVOID when it comes to Hackintosh,
i5-9400 running at 2.9GHz (Base), and a Gigabyte Windforce OC GTX 1060 3GB.

The reasoning of me uploading this is because I lose a lot of my things, the other day I accidentally formatted a hard drive because of "Logical Drives" in Windows...

nonetheless...I need a backup of this, because it's important? i guess. Ever since my Dell Optiplex XE2 to this machine now "Ivy" I've had bad luck and this EFI has worked! I need to keep it and if you wanna try it, go right ahead! 

**CHIPSETS SUPPORTED**

H310, B365, B360, H370, Q370, Z370, Z390.

If you would ever like to run this on Mojave or newer, beware that you'll need to change some things.

#1 - SMBIOS, go ahead and download "GenSMBIOS". Generate with the SMBIOS (iMac19,1 FOR iGPU, iMac19,2 FOR dGPU (ANYTHING SUPPORTED IN ABOVE MOJAVE OR NEWER))

NVIDIA IS NOT SUPPORTED IN MOJAVE OR NEWER!!

#2 - Patch the iGPU (If you need it), there is a method on the Dortania Github! (https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config.plist/coffee-lake.html#platforminfo)

If you don't patch it there will be NO graphics acceleration, meaning slower preformance, not transparent taskbar, shitty video playback, etc..

And if you don't need the iGPU, make sure you have a supported one. I recommend an RX 570 or 580. Even a 480 is okay..

That's really all I have to say, I'm not responsible if this fucks with your system (which is technically impossible).

If you need any help head to Dortania, I'm not your guy. This is really just for keep sake but if you wanna try and use it go ahead.
